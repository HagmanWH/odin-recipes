        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>This is the way to get crisp bacon without having to constantly turn it, watch over it, or get burnt by splatters of grease.</p>
          <p>It 'fries' up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes BLT sandwiches much easier. Very nice when feeding a family or crowd. </p>            
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>1 pound thick sliced bacon</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
              <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange bacon on baking sheet in a single layer with the edges touching or slightly overlapping.</li>
              <li>Bake in preheated oven to desired degree of doneness, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove bacon from the baking sheet with tongs or a fork, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
          </ol>
