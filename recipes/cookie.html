        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>These have been voted the number one cookie that I bake (and I bake a lot!), and are loved by all who eat them. They are chewy mapley good!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
              <li>1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
              <li>1/2 cup margarine, softened</li>
              <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons real maple syrup</li>
              <li>1 egg</li>
              <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
              <li>1/4 cup maple sugar</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
              <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 1 cup of white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and maple syrup. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until just mixed. In a small dish, mix together the remaining 1/2 cup white sugar and the maple sugar. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and roll the balls in the sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
              <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be crackly on top and look wet in the middle. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
          </ol>
